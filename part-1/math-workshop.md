# workshop

demystifying math in software engineering

**introduction**

- aim of the workshop is to brige the gap between software engineering and math
- math is a tool, not a barrier, it plays a role in improving efficiency, performance, functionality, etc.

**a (very) brief introduction to fundamentals of mathematical notation and functions**
 
> understanding functions and their notation
$$f(x)=x^2$$
$$a\cdot f(x) \Rightarrow \text{multiplies the y-value by } a \Rightarrow \text{vertical transformation}$$

$$f(x/b) \Rightarrow \text{multiplies the x-value by } b \Rightarrow \text{horizontal transformation}$$

$$f(x-c) \Rightarrow \text{shifts graph } c \text{ units to the right} \Rightarrow \text{horizontal translation}$$

$$f(x)+d \Rightarrow \text{shifts graph } d \text{ units upward} \Rightarrow \text{vertial translation}$$


**breaking down a scary looking function**
> sample equation which gave birth to this workshop actually:

$$g(x)=\frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi (2n-1)ft)}{2n-1}$$

$t=\text{time}$ $f=\text{frequency}$ $n=\text{iterations}$

> what are we looking at?

1. summation $\sum$, i.e. we are dealing with a function built from multiple smaller functions added together
2. sine $\sin$ function on the inside, suggesting we are dealing with waves or oscillations
3. denominator $2n-1$ hints that terms get smaller as $n$ gets smaller, i.e. later terms will have less influence
4. $2\pi ft$ inside the sine tells us this function is time-dependent and periodic

> what can we do to break this down further?

1. ignore the sum and investigate first term, which means we'll substitute $1$ for every $n$ we "find", i.e.

$$g_{1}(t)$$

2. working this out we get

$$=\frac{4}{\pi}\cdot \frac{\sin(2\pi (2(1)-1)ft)}{2(1)-1}$$

$$=\frac{4}{\pi}\cdot \frac{\sin(2\pi (1)ft)}{1}$$

$$=\frac{4}{\pi}\cdot\sin(2\pi ft)$$

$$g_{1}(t)=\frac{4}{\pi}\sin(2\pi ft)$$

*why is the variable suddenly $t$ and not $x$? because we are dealing with a function of time*

> essentially, we have a basic sine wave function

1. the function, no matter how exactly will it look, will probably (definitely) resemble a wave

2. let's plot the graph of the second term will look like

3. combining these we get

![](./assets/sum-two-terms.png)

4. skipping ahead to the tenth term function

![](./assets/tenth-term-function.png)

5. smack it on top of all previous functions for each term, i.e. $=[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]$

**vectors (not the math kind) i.e. arrays**

> one-dimensional array, a row

1. visualizing this is very straight-forward, see below

![](./assets/1d-array.png)

2. in terms of expressing this in programming, again, piece of cake

``` 
one_d_array = [
    0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1
]
```

> two-dimensional array, a table

1. again, nothing crazy, we expand the row of data into a table

![](./assets/2d-array.png)

2. programmatically speaking, maybe a little more confusing but imagine it as a table and you're good, notice the nested square brackets

```
two_d_array = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

> three-dimensional array, many tables "linked" behind one another

1. visually, imagine a screen where you want to have control over what color is being displayed apart from just controlling the state of a pixel

![](./assets/3d-array-frontal.png) ![](./assets/3d-array-rotated.png)

2. translating this to programming becomes a little more "messy" but with the newly gained knowledge, we should manage, e.g.
```
              â•­(first bracket, 1d)
              ðŸ¢“
three_d_arr = [ 

    â•­(second bracket, 2d)
    ðŸ¢“
    [   
        â•­(third bracket, 3d)
        ðŸ¢“
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    ],
    [
        [None,      "#74DB84",  None,       None,       None,       None,       None,       None],
        [None,      None,       "#DC75CD",  None,       None,       "#E8C11C",  None,       None],
        [None,      None,       "#DC75CD",  None,       None,       "#E8C11C",  None,       None],
        [None,      None,       "#DC75CD",  None,       None,       "#E8C11C",  None,       None],
        [None,      None,       None,       None,       None,       None,       None,       None],
        [None,      "#236B8E",  None,       None,       None,       None,       "#236B8E",  None],
        [None,      None,       "#236B8E",  "#236B8E",  "#236B8E",  "#236B8E",  None,       None],
        [None,      None,       None,       None,       None,       None,       None,       None],
    ],
]
```
3. this array is is defined as depth-first stack where by selecting the first layer we can access individual rows and colums as if we were traversing a 2d-array

**binary tree**

> what?

- data structure expressed as a figurative tree
- one root node
- nodes can only have one parent node and at most two children nodes (left and right)
- foundation for more complex structures such as binary search tree, syntax tree, etc.

```
        1
       / \
      /   \
     7     9
    / \     \
   2   6     9
      / \   / 
     5  11  5

an unbalanced and unsorted binary tree, height = 3 i.e., the number of edges from farthest node to root node (1), size = 9, i.e., total number of nodes
```

> why?

- it is an excellent entry point for many algorithms with real world applications such as
    - file system representation (that's a lie, horrible example, albeit those are trees as well)
    - compilers reading source code construct a syntax tree to represent structure of the code
    - game trees such as tic, tac, toe, where each node of a tree represents a state of the game
- allows me to demonstrate how to traverse a binary tree or a similar graph or tree structure

> algorithm (math) to programming, DFS

- starts at root and goes down as far as it can down a branch, backtracks till it finds an unexplored path, explores, etc. etc.
1.  in order to write the algorithm, let's decide how we'll store the binary tree structure in code

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

- the above is python implementation of what is called linked node representation
- we chose this as it is more suitable for real world implementation where we encounter imperfect/incomplete binary trees more often than perfect ones

2. to connect the parent nodes to their children nodes, we can make a simple function

```
def connect(parent, left=None, right=None):
    parent.left = left
    parent.right = right
```

3. then, we define a couple of nodes representing the binary tree showcased earlier

```
connect(firstNode, secondNode, thirdNode)
connect(secondNode, fourthNode, fifthNode)
```

4. finally, we follow the dfs algorithm to traverse the tree

```python
def depth_first_search(root, value):
    if root is None:
        return False
    root.visited = True
    
    if root.data == value:
        return True

    left_result = depth_first_search(root.left, value)
    right_result = depth_first_search(root.right, value)

    return left_result or right_result
```

- thus the full call stack would look something like this when looking for the value 11

```
depth_first_search(1, 11)
â”œâ”€â”€ depth_first_search(7, 11)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ depth_first_search(2, 11) â†’ False
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ depth_first_search(6, 11)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ depth_first_search(5, 11) â†’ False
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ depth_first_search(11, 11) â†’ True
â””â”€â”€ short-circuits here, no need to call right child (9)
```

**scary terms**
- matrix
- big-o notation
