# Demystifying Math in Software Engineering

Welcome to the companion repo for the **Demystifying Math in Software Engineering** lecture!

## ðŸŽ¯ About the Lecture

This lecture is designed for software students and developers looking to better understand the math behind core programming concepts. It's not about solving equations or doing calculationsâ€”it's about *seeing how math shows up in code* and making it approachable, visual, and relevant.

> This is a lecture (not a workshop), so there are no hands-on tasks, but active participation and questions are highly encouraged!
